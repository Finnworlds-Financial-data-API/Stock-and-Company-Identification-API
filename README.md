<h1>Stock and Company identification API - Finnworlds</h1>

<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/finance-data/stock-and-company-identification-numbers-api/">Stock and company identification API</a> 
is a useful tool that lets you pull stock ticker and company information from our database through JSON REST API and our databases are also downloadable as an excel or csv file.
You can use the Stock and Company Identifiers API to access an active and up-to-date database without having to collect and maintain a huge amount of data from multiple sources yourself. 
The API is expanded regularly as we add new stocks and exchange traded funds in the database. 
You can access to the Stock and Company Identifiers API without having to continuously worry about the quality and the quantity of the data you are using to develop your project. 
Better focus results in better quality projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/">Finnworlds</a>Â has clients of all sizes. Mostly we work directly with developers who develop platforms for their clients but we also partner with inhouse development teams. Either way we have a package for every size of business</p>
